## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer specializing in building high-performance data platforms and mission-critical systems. Currently working on tools to support advanced telemetry processing / analysis and real-time rocket control. TLDR; building software in Aerospace. ðŸš€

My expertise spans JavaScript, Node, React, TypeScript, Golang, and AWS, with a focus on creating scalable, efficient solutions. Previously, I've developed SaaS platforms, decentralized digital objects, and reusable component systems.

Beyond tech, I'm passionate about space exploration, finance, food, and walks :)
